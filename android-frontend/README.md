# RendezVenue Event Management 
This is your new go-to app for retrieving, collecting, and curating events on the fly within an Android environment. RendezVenue simplifies the hassle of scouring event content with a targeted search functionality to get the events you want, 
where and when you need them.

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository, and any of the files contained within, is part of a larger project.
>
> This Android application relies upon data and services provided to it by the RendezVenue API.
> 
> The RendezVenue API exists in a separate repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/JannelJ/event-api).

## Overview

RendezVenue boasts a slick UI experience, with automatic background location filtering kicking in from the get-go, granting instant access to events as far as the eye can see. Entrusting response caching and computationally-demanding processes 
to the backend keeps the user experience uninterrupted. The frontend team have worked hard on embellishing the visuals with snappy graphics, elegantly designed, laid out, and all carefully chosen to complement the overarching theme.



  
## User Flow

The application opens up to a carefully considered home page. The bottom menu bar acts as the main point of navigation within the app, with the top bar allowing users consistent access to their calendar throughout the app. 
The Home page features: 
- A section to display two Events saved by the user
- A search bar, giving another point of access to the Explore page
- A selection of buttons, providing quick access to Event listings filtered by the category of event

The application allows users to search for events with a range of filtering options. Once an event is found clicking it will open up a more detailed view, allowing a user to add it to their calendar with ease.
Creating events is also a breeze with our fillable form, utilising text fields, dropdown menus and picker dialogs to make the process as easy as possible for the user and robust input sanitisation for our API. Once an event is created a pop-up is displayed, asking the user if they wish to also add the event to their own calendar.
